6. If you're running the backend server on your local machine, change all the 'url' variables in the frontend JS files to localhost (if you're on a virtual machine, make sure that the address points to your active Node.js backend
```javascript
const url = 'http://localhost:3000';
```
7. Open the frontend's 'home' html file in the Live Server on WebStorm or install [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) on Visual Studio Code and run the frontend there.
